INTRODUCTION 					*jupyter-vim-introduction*

This plugin allows vim to interact directly with a Jupyter kernel. It provides
commands to connect to the kernel (or this can be done automatically whenever
you open a code file), and to send code directly from your buffer to the
kernel.

This plugin was originally forked from
[vim-ipython](<https://github.com/wmvanvliet/vim-ipython>), but has been
updated substantially to stay up-to-date with the most recent versions of the
jupyter console. For a more complete list of changes, see
|jupyter-vim-vs-vim-ipython|.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE 						*jupyter-vim-usage*

This plugin is intended to be used with side-by-side terminals, or with
a multiplexer such as `tmux`. The idea is to edit your python script in vim,
and be able to send commands to Jupyter, which is running in the other
terminal. No more copy/alt-tab/paste!

To begin:
	$ jupyter qtconsole &  # open a jupyter console window
	$ vim <your_script>.py
	:JupyterConnect

The |:JupyterConnect| command attempts to connect to the Jupyter kernel; by
default it guesses the language of the kernel based on the filetype (see
|b:jupyter_kernel_type|).  For example, running the command |:JupyterConnect|
while in a *.py buffer will attempt a connection to a Python Jupyter kernel,
whereas in a *.jl buffer it will attempt to connect to a Julia Jupyter kernel.

Note that the connection process will hang for ~5 seconds if no kernel is
available. This is why the option |g:jupyter_auto_connect| defaults to 0 (off)
-- otherwise opening *.py files would be very slow whenever a kernel is not
running. This issue would be mitigated by an asynchronous connection process (a
work in progress).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*jupyter-vim-commands*

:JupyterConnect [connection_file]	    *jupyter-connect* *:JupyterConnect*
			Connect to an existing `jupyter kernel`. Kernel may be
			any type (not just IPython). Connection attempt will
			timeout after five seconds, and give a warning. Other
			functionality of the plugin will not be available unless
			connected to a kernel.

                        This command assumes the language of the Jupyter kernel
                        is |b:jupyter_kernel_type|; errors may occur if the
                        kernel type is incorrect.

			An optional [connection_file] can be given. It must
			match the name or the id of the kernel connection
			file given by `ipython kernel -f connection_file`,
			by default it looks like `kernel-13423.json`.

			To see connection information press |g<|

			Note this command is running in an other thread

			Note that a `jupyter console` need not be running to
			connect to a `jupyter kernel`, but the console is
			necessary to display any output from your python code!

:JupyterDiconnect			         *jupyter-disconnect* *:JupyterDiconnect*
			Diconnect from the currently connected kernel.

:JupyterCd [dir] 				*jupyter-cd* *:JupyterCd*
			Change the working directory of the kernel to [dir].
                        Functions just like the typical shell command.
			Some special path can be given:
			  ""  -> $HOME directory.
			  "-" -> Previous working directory (works in most
			  shells)
			  "%" -> Current file directory
			After that, the path given will be expanded. See
			|expand()|

:JupyterRunFile [flags] [filename] 	    *jupyter-runfile* *:JupyterRunFile*
                        Run an entire file. The [flags] argument only affects
                        Python kernels. If [flags] and [filename] are empty,
                        the filename of the current buffer is used. The
                        [filename] is taken as the last argument to the
                        command.

                        For Python kernels, this command uses the IPython
                        "%run" magic (with __name__ == "__main__").  Execute
                        "%run?" in an IPython console to read the documentation
                        about the "%run" magic.

                        Global IPython flags may also be set via
                        |g:ipython_run_flags|.  These flags will be applied to
                        any call without flags:
				:JupyterRunFile my_script.py
			Inclusion of [flags] will override the global flags.
			For example, to run the current buffer in the
			interactive IPython environment:
				:JupyterRunFile -i %:p

:PythonImportThisFile 	      *jupyter-importthisfile* *:PythonImportThisFile*
                        Only makes sense to run when |b:jupyter_kernel_type| is
                        'python'.  Imports the current buffer as a python
                        module.  Essentially, this command runs
				:JupyterRunFile -n %:p
			The IPython "%run" magic handles stripping the
			extension and running the `import` command.

:JupyterSendCode {code}			*jupyter-sendcode* *:JupyterSendCode*
			Send a raw line of code to the jupyter kernel.

:[count]JupyterSendCount               	*jupyter-sendcount* *:JupyterSendCount*
			Send [count] lines to the kernel. If [count] is not
			given, the current line is sent.
			
:[range]JupyterSendRange               	*jupyter-sendrange* *:JupyterSendRange*
			Send the [range] of lines to the kernel. If [range] is
			not given, the current line is sent.

:JupyterSendCell                	*jupyter-sendcell* *:JupyterSendCell*
			Send the current code cell, as delineated by the lines
			matching |g:jupyter_cell_separators|

:PythonSetBreak 			*python-setbreak* *:PythonSetBreak*
                        Only makes sense to run when |b:jupyter_kernel_type| is
                        'python'. Sets a pdb debugging stop at the current
                        line. Currently, this command is a rudimentary hack
                        that just inserts:
				import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
			into the python file. You will need to hop over to the
			`jupyter [qt]console` to operate pdb. Future features
			include more robust debugging commands, and integration
			of IPython tracebacks into the quickfix menu, so you
			don't have to squint at the screen to see where your
			error occurred.

:JupyterUpdateShell 		*jupyter-updateshell* *:JupyterUpdateShell*
			Get any pending I/O messages from the kernel, and
			print them in the `__jupyter_console__` buffer. If
			|g:jupyter_monitor_console| == 1, this update will
			happen automatically when any :JupyterSend* command is
			executed. The pseudo console will open in a split.

			Note: This function is a relic from the original
			vim-ipython. The `jupyter qtconsole` already displays
			all sent code and corresponding output, records history,
			etc. It is far easier to alt-tab into jupyter for
			interactive use than to try to replicate that
			functionality within vim; however, I have left the
			pseudo console in as a useful debugging tool for the
			message handler, because we can easily print additional
			output from the client/kernel messaging protocol.

JupyterUpdateMonitor 		      *jupyter-updatemonitor* *:JupyterUpdateMonitor*
			Update the monitor buffer. See |g:jupyter_monitor_console|.

JupyterTerminateKernel [signal]        *jupyter-terminatekernel* *:JupyterTerminateKernel*
			Send [signal] to the connected kernel. [signal] is by
			default SIGTERM (15). It can be a python signal
			constant or an integer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION					*jupyter-vim-configuration*

`b:jupyter_kernel_type`                             *b:jupyter_kernel_type*
Default: inferred from filetype                     Language of the kernel

Buffer-local variable that indicates what language vim will assume the Jupyter
kernel accepts. By default, this value is inferred from the filetype of the
buffer, according to the mapping:
+--------------------+-----------------+
| Filetype           | Kernel language |
+--------------------+-----------------+
| sh                 | 'bash'          |
| c                  | 'cpp'           |
| cpp                | 'cpp'           |
| java               | 'java'          |
| javascript         | 'javascript'    |
| julia              | 'julia'         |
| perl               | 'perl'          |
| python             | 'python'        |
| r                  | 'ir'            |
| raku               | 'raku'          |
| perl6              | 'raku'          |
| ruby               | 'ruby'          |
| rust               | 'rust'          |
| <everything else>  | 'none'          |
+--------------------+-----------------+

`b:ipython_run_flags` 			            *b:ipython_run_flags*
Default: '' 				Flags for "%run" IPython magic

Buffer-local variable to append [flags] to the |:JupyterRunFile| command for
that buffer. Typical flags include "-i" to run the file in the current IPython
kernel namespace, or "-d" to start the `pdb` debugger at the first line of the
file.

See:
<http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-run>
or type "%run?" in the `jupyter [qt]console` for more information.

`g:jupyter_auto_connect`   			*g:jupyter_auto_connect*
Default: 0 				Automatically connect to kernel

This setting determines if vim will automatically run |:JupyterConnect| for any
code file whose filetype is associated with a kernel language (other than
'none') as described in |b:jupyter_kernel_type|. Due to the nature of the
connection process, vim will be slow to start up if this option is set to 1. An
asynchronous connection process is a work in progress.

`b:jupyter_exec_*`     		*b:jupyter_exec_before* *b:jupyter_exec_pre*
				  *b:jupyter_exec_post* *b:jupyter_exec_after*
Default: ''

Example: `autocmd FileType python let b:jupyter_exec_before = 'clear-screen'`
These variables if exist, will send another execute_request before, after each
user message or be preprended, appended to each message.

`g:jupyter_cell_separators`        		*g:jupyter_cell_separators*
				  List of regex to separate jupyter cells
Default: ['##', '#%%', '# %%', '# <codecell>']

Define how jupyter-vim will find the current cell when running
|:JupyterSendCell|.
Example: `let g:jupyter_cell_separators = ['.*separator-placeholder']` will
consider a cell every lines between two lines containing separator-placeholder
string.
The match starts at the beginning of line: hence the `.*` in the previous
example

`g:jupyter_mapkeys`   					*g:jupyter_mapkeys*
Default: 1 					Map keys for python files

By default, jupyter-vim will map the keys, as described in
|jupyter-vim-mappings|. Set to 0 to create your own mappings in your vimrc.

`g:jupyter_monitor_console`   			*g:jupyter_monitor_console*
Default: 0 				Automatically update pseudo console

Setting this option to 1 will cause jupyter-vim to create a pseudo console
buffer named `__jupyter_console__` to display I/O messages from the running
`jupyter kernel`. Messages will be updated any time a :JupyterSend* or
:JupyterRunFile command is sent. The |:JupyterUpdateShell| command forces an
update, regardless of whether the |g:jupyter_monitor_console| option is set.

`g:jupyter_verbose`   					*g:jupyter_verbose*
Default: 0 					Echo sent messages to vim

If set to 1, this option will echo any message sent to the kernel on the vim
command line (see |:echomsg|). The `jupyter qtconsole` displays messages
instantaneously, so echoing them in vim as well is redundant. It can be useful,
however, for debugging kernel messaging issues, or if you just like visual
confirmation in multiple places that your message has been sent.


Note that the `jupyter console` (not `qt`), does `not` echo messages from other
clients until <Enter> is pressed. I am working on a non-blocking or threaded
channel version of this client to eliminate this issue. Until then, stick with
`jupyter qtconsole`!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JUPYTER-VIM VS. VIM-IPYTHON 			*jupyter-vim-vs-vim-ipython*

Major changes include:
        - jupyter-vim works with both Python and Julia kernels, and is
          restructured so that more languages can be added in the future (no
          Python-specific stuff baked in).
	- The pseudo-terminal vim pane functionality has been rewritten with
	  a vimscript function, and a cleaned up python function. The
	  `jupyter qtconsole` allows the configuration option:
		c.ConsoleWidget.include_other_output = True
	  and `jupyter console` allows:
		c.ZMQTerminalInteractiveShell.include_other_output = True
	  which allow the console to echo the commands sent by vim (or any
	  other client), as well as the output of the commands. There is no
	  need to replicate this functionality within vim, though I have left
	  the option at present for debugging the jupyter-vim message handler
	  while I develop the python debugging tools.
	  (NOTE: at present, the `jupyter console` will only refresh on
	  <Enter>, so it does not quite do what we're hoping for regarding vim
	  interaction. I am working on a patch to the jupyter terminal-based
	  console to fix this issue.)
	- The original python documentation look-up and completion code has
	  been removed. Instead, use [jedi-vim](<link_here>).
	- Many of the original <Plug> mappings have been replaced with vim
	  commands, so they may be used without a user mapping.
	- Default keymaps now use <localleader>.
	- A general `plugin` was created (in addition to the `ftplugin`), so
	  that jupyter-vim could be expanded to work with any filetype for which
	  a `jupyter kernel` exists.
